# Technology-Innovation-and-Entrepreneurship
Context: As part of the European Union’s Startup Framework Facility (SFF), our team operated under the assumption of being an early-stage startup tasked with identifying a scalable innovation to penetrate a competitive market.
Solution: In collaboration with Leevo, we conceptualized and developed a live shopping application designed to disrupt the e-commerce landscape by integrating real-time interactive shopping experiences. The project followed a rigorous methodological approach:

Theoretical Foundation: Conducted comprehensive market research and competitive analysis to validate the viability of live shopping in the EU market.

Design & Prototyping: Translated theoretical insights into actionable design frameworks, creating user journey maps, wireframes, and high-fidelity mockups to visualize the platform’s UX/UI.

Final Deliverables: Presented a holistic business and technical strategy, supported by a professionally curated PDF report detailing the innovation’s value proposition, technical architecture, and scalability roadmap.

Outcome: The solution aligned with EU priorities for digital transformation and SME growth, positioning it as a compelling case study for market entry under the SFF’s innovation-driven objectives.
